Talk Notes

Example 1:

  Don't you love StackOverflow.com?

  Awkward but common way to build up a Map of results.

Example 2:

  nio Path instead of File
  newDirectoryStream() instead of listFiles() -- iterator pattern, more efficient
  But it is a Closeable resource, so needs to be managed

  There is Files.readAllLines(), but that could use a lot of memory

  I hardly use Java 7 nio because we use libraries for I/O
  . e.g. commons-io
  . e.g. Spring InputStreamSource/template
  . e.g. groovy.jar

Example 3:

  YearMonth instead of String
  .forEach with Consumer<K,V>
  Files.list() returns a Stream instead of an Iterator
  Map#merge() is a good improvement
  See also compute(), computeIfAbsent(), computeIfPresent()

Example 4:

  Note checked exceptions getting in the way
  Note heavy chaining and lazy stream processing could make debugging challenging
